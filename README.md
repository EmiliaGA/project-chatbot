# Project Name

The assignment was to build a chat bot with eventlisteners for the form submit event. The value from the input should be stored and posted as a message from the user. The chat bot app should progress to the next question. There was a starter code for HTML, CSS and Javascript. The starter code included the first message from the bot.

## The problem

We were given a starter code and a demo app from Technigo to start from. I used other students code as support to understand how the code works and how to build my own version. Future iterations of the chatbot will include better response in messages using the timeOut function, also added button option and responses, offering a more anvanced conversation.
